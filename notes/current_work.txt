Services provided:

- Track the performance of a fleet of vehicles and diagnose problems with a vehicle's engine, transmission, electrical system, etc. 
  This information can be used to identify vehicles with problems and take corrective actions like recommending repairs before the problems 
  cause significant damage. 
- Knowing that the existing system can already get vehicles' information, the DTC information can supplement the Fleet Management System by: 
  - Warn the driver if a problem is detected 
  - Provide support to the malfunction notification mechanism (MIL light) by displaying real-time feedback information to drivers. 
  - Support automated tasks like recalled vehicles so that they can take their vehicles to a dealership to perform the necessary repairs, 
    schedule predictive maintenance before a problem occurs, or automatically generate repair orders for spare parts.
For this information to become relevant it has to be able, the system has to transmit the data outside of the vehicle, so APIs
and other external services can use the data.
